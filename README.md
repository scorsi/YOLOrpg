# Sparkling Eyes RPG
A text RPG in C++ for Linux. Tested and developed for `Ubuntu 16.04LTS`.

### How to play it

You need to compile it. Yes, you have the sources code.

_No, don't be afraid, it is really simple!_

You only need theses packages:
* CMake
* Make
* gcc
* git

You first need to get the sources code.
```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/scorsi/sparkling-eyes-rpg.git

You now have a new folder named `sparkling-eyes-rpg`. You have to go into.
```
cd sparkling-eyes-rpg
```

You are into the folder. You have to compile the project.
