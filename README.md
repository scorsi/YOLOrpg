# Sparkling Eyes RPG
A text RPG in C++ for Linux. Tested and developed for `Ubuntu 16.04LTS`. Never finished.

### How to play it

You need to compile it. Yes, you have the sources code.

No, don't be afraid, it is really simple!

You only need theses packages:
* CMake
* Make
* gcc
* git _(if you don't download the zipped project)_

You can get the game by typing this line `git clone https://github.com/scorsi/sparkling-eyes-rpg.git`.
Or by downloading the zipped project.

You have to compile the game. Go into the folder and run `./compile.sh`.
You should clean the compilations' traces by running `./clean.sh`.

You can now launch the game by running the following binary `./sparkling_eyes_rpg`.

Here you are, you finished! This was really simple you see? :-)
